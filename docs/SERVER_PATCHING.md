# Server Update and Patching Procedures

This document provides guidelines and best practices for updating the game server with new versions (patches). The goal is to ensure that patches are deployed smoothly, reliably, and with minimal downtime.

## Introduction

Regular server updates are essential for introducing new content, features, bug fixes, and balance changes. A well-defined patching process minimizes risks, prevents extended outages, and ensures players have a consistent and positive experience.

## Pre-Patch Checklist

Before deploying any patch, complete the following steps:

1.  **Version Control:**
    *   Ensure all code changes for the patch are committed to the appropriate branch in the version control system (e.g., Git).
    *   The deployment should be from a tagged, stable release branch.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   **Comprehensive QA:** The patch must undergo thorough testing in a dedicated QA or staging environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This includes:
        *   Functional testing (new features, bug fixes).
        *   Balance testing (for gameplay changes).
        *   Regression testing (ensuring existing functionality isn't broken).
        *   Performance testing (load testing, stress testing).
        *   Compatibility testing (if client changes are involved).
    *   **Automated Tests:** Ensure all relevant automated tests (unit, integration) are passing for the release candidate build.
3.  **Database Management:**
    *   **Backup Production Database:** Always perform a full backup of the production database before applying any patch, especially if the patch involves schema changes.
    *   **Migration Scripts:** If the patch requires database schema changes, prepare and test migration scripts thoroughly. These scripts should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
4.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Verify all server configurations (e.g., environment variables, service endpoints) for the new patch are correct for the target environment (staging/production).
5.  **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Have a documented and tested rollback plan in case the patch fails or causes critical issues. This might involve reverting to the previous code version and restoring the database from backup.
6.  **Communication Plan (Internal & External):**
    *   **Internal:** Notify relevant internal teams (dev, QA, support, community management) about the patching schedule.
    *   **External (Players):**
        *   Schedule a maintenance window if downtime is expected.
        *   Communicate the maintenance window and expected downtime to players in advance through appropriate channels (in-game announcements, forums, social media).
        *   Prepare patch notes detailing changes for players.
7.  **Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Ensure monitoring tools (server performance, error logging, game analytics) are in place and functioning correctly to observe the patch's impact.

## Deployment Process

The exact deployment process may vary based on the server architecture and tools used (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines).

1.  **Deploy to Staging Environment:**
    *   Deploy the patch to the staging environment first.
    *   Perform a final round of smoke tests and critical functionality checks in staging.
2.  **Production Deployment Strategy:**
    *   **Blue/Green Deployment (Recommended for minimizing downtime):**
        *   Provision a new "green" environment with the patched version alongside the existing "blue" production environment.
        *   Once the green environment is tested and deemed stable, switch traffic from blue to green.
        *   Keep the blue environment running temporarily for quick rollback if needed.
    *   **Canary Release:**
        *   Roll out the patch to a small subset of production servers/users.
        *   Monitor closely. If stable, gradually roll out to the rest of the servers.
    *   **In-Place Update (Higher risk of downtime):**
        *   If unavoidable, take servers offline, deploy the new version, and bring them back online. This will cause downtime.
3.  **Execute Database Migrations:**
    *   Run any necessary database migration scripts. This should ideally be done during a period of low traffic or within the scheduled maintenance window.
4.  **Deploy Application Code:**
    *   Deploy the new application code/binaries to the production servers.
5.  **Clear Caches:**
    *   Clear any relevant server-side or CDN caches.
6.  **Restart Services:**
    *   Perform a rolling restart of application services to ensure they pick up the new code and configuration.

## Post-Patch Monitoring

After the patch is deployed to production:

1.  **Monitor Key Metrics:**
    *   Closely watch server performance metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O).
    *   Monitor error rates in logging systems.
    *   Check game-specific analytics for any unusual trends (e.g., drop in active players, high disconnect rates, unusual game outcomes).
2.  **Verify Critical Systems:**
    *   Confirm that core game functionalities are working as expected (e.g., login, matchmaking, in-game actions, purchases).
3.  **Community Feedback:**
    *   Monitor community channels for player reports of new issues.
4.  **Be Prepared to Rollback:**
    *   If critical issues are detected that cannot be quickly resolved, execute the rollback plan.

## Rollback Procedure

1.  **Decision:** The decision to roll back should be made quickly if major problems arise.
2.  **Communication:** Inform players if a rollback is necessary and when they can expect the game to be available again.
3.  **Revert Code:**
    *   If using Blue/Green, switch traffic back to the "blue" environment.
    *   Otherwise, redeploy the previous stable version of the code.
4.  **Restore Database (if necessary):**
    *   If the patch involved breaking database changes that were not backward-compatible, restore the database from the pre-patch backup. This is a critical step and can be time-consuming.
5.  **Post-Mortem:** After a rollback, conduct a thorough investigation to understand what went wrong and how to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Best Practices

*   **Automation:** Automate as much of the build, test, and deployment process as possible using CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage your server infrastructure using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation for consistency and reproducibility.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat servers as immutable. Instead of patching existing servers, deploy new servers with the updated code and then decommission the old ones.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for managing server configurations.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Ensure comprehensive logging is in place to help diagnose issues.
*   **Regular Drills:** Practice the patching and rollback procedures regularly in a non-production environment.
*   **Small, Frequent Patches:** Prefer smaller, more frequent patches over large, infrequent ones. This reduces the risk and complexity of each deployment.
*   **Zero-Downtime Focus:** Design your architecture and processes with the goal of achieving zero or minimal downtime during patching.

By following these procedures and best practices, you can ensure that server updates enhance the game and maintain a stable experience for your players.
