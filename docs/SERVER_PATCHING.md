# Server Update and Patching Procedures

This document provides guidelines and best practices for updating the game server with new versions (patches). The goal is to ensure that patches are deployed smoothly, reliably, and with minimal downtime.

## Introduction

Regular server updates are essential for introducing new content, features, bug fixes, and balance changes. A well-defined patching process minimizes risks, prevents extended outages, and ensures players have a consistent and positive experience.

## Pre-Patch Checklist

Before deploying any patch, complete the following steps:

1.  **Version Control:**
    *   Ensure all code changes for the patch are committed to the appropriate branch in the version control system (e.g., Git).
    *   The deployment should be from a tagged, stable release branch.
2.  **Testing:**
    *   **Comprehensive QA:** The patch must undergo thorough testing in a dedicated QA or staging environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. This includes:
        *   Functional testing (new features, bug fixes).
        *   Balance testing (for gameplay changes).
        *   Regression testing (ensuring existing functionality isn't broken).
        *   Performance testing (load testing, stress testing).
        *   Compatibility testing (if client changes are involved).
    *   **Automated Tests:** Ensure all relevant automated tests (unit, integration) are passing for the release candidate build.
3.  **Database Management:**
    *   **Backup Production Database:** Always perform a full backup of the production database before applying any patch, especially if the patch involves schema changes.
    *   **Migration Scripts:** If the patch requires database schema changes, prepare and test migration scripts thoroughly. These scripts should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
4.  **Configuration Management:**
    *   Verify all server configurations (e.g., environment variables, service endpoints) for the new patch are correct for the target environment (staging/production).
5.  **Rollback Plan:**
    *   Have a documented and tested rollback plan in case the patch fails or causes critical issues. This might involve reverting to the previous code version and restoring the database from backup.
6.  **Communication Plan (Internal & External):**
    *   **Internal:** Notify relevant internal teams (dev, QA, support, community management) about the patching schedule.
    *   **External (Players):**
        *   Schedule a maintenance window if downtime is expected.
        *   Communicate the maintenance window and expected downtime to players in advance through appropriate channels (in-game announcements, forums, social media).
        *   Prepare patch notes detailing changes for players.
7.  **Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Ensure monitoring tools (server performance, error logging, game analytics) are in place and functioning correctly to observe the patch's impact.

## Deployment Process

**Disclaimer:** *The following steps and commands are generalized examples. Your specific server architecture, tooling (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, specific cloud provider CLI, etc.), and scripts (`./stop-server.sh`, etc.) will differ. Adapt these steps to your actual environment and always test thoroughly in a staging environment first.*

1.  **Deploy to Staging Environment:**
    *   Always deploy the patch to the staging environment first.
    *   **Example (if using a manual script):**
        ```bash
        ./deploy_to_staging.sh <release_branch_or_tag>
        ```
    *   Perform a final round of smoke tests and critical functionality checks in staging.

2.  **Production Deployment Strategy:**

    Choose a strategy based on your infrastructure and risk tolerance.

    *   **A. Blue/Green Deployment (Recommended for minimizing downtime):**
        1.  **Provision Green Environment:** Create a new, identical "green" environment. This might involve:
            ```bash
            # Example using a hypothetical cloud CLI or IaC tool
            infra-tool apply -target=green-environment -vars version=<new_patch_version>
            ```
        2.  **Deploy to Green:** Deploy the new patch version to the green environment.
            ```bash
            ./deploy_to_green.sh <new_patch_version>
            ```
        3.  **Test Green:** Thoroughly test the green environment (automated checks, critical path manual tests).
        4.  **Switch Traffic:** Redirect live traffic from the "blue" (old) environment to the "green" (new) environment. This is often done at the load balancer or DNS level.
            ```bash
            # Example: Update load balancer to point to green instances
            lb-tool update-traffic --target-group=green --weight=100
            lb-tool update-traffic --target-group=blue --weight=0
            ```
        5.  **Monitor Green:** Closely monitor the green environment under full load.
        6.  **Decommission Blue:** After a period of stability (e.g., 24 hours), decommission the blue environment.
            ```bash
            infra-tool destroy -target=blue-environment
            ```

    *   **B. Canary Release:**
        1.  **Select Canary Servers:** Identify a small subset of your production servers for the initial rollout.
        2.  **Deploy to Canaries:** Deploy the patch only to these canary servers.
            ```bash
            ./deploy_to_canary_servers.sh <new_patch_version> --servers=server1,server2
            ```
        3.  **Monitor Canaries:** Intensely monitor these servers for errors, performance issues, and user feedback.
        4.  **Gradual Rollout:** If canaries are stable, gradually deploy to more servers in batches.
            ```bash
            ./deploy_to_production_batch.sh <new_patch_version> --batch=1
            ./deploy_to_production_batch.sh <new_patch_version> --batch=2
            # ...and so on
            ```
        5.  **Full Rollout:** Once confident, deploy to all remaining servers.

    *   **C. In-Place Update (Higher risk of downtime - use during scheduled maintenance):**
        1.  **Announce Maintenance:** Ensure players are aware of the scheduled downtime.
        2.  **Stop Services:** Stop the game servers/application services.
            ```bash
            # Example:
            ssh user@your-server-ip "cd /srv/game && ./stop-server.sh"
            # Or for multiple servers:
            # ansible-playbook stop_game_servers.yml
            ```
        3.  **(Conditional) Backup Database:** If not done in pre-patch, or if another quick backup is desired.
        4.  **Execute Database Migrations:** Run any necessary database migration scripts.
            ```bash
            ssh user@your-db-migration-runner "cd /srv/game-migrations && ./run-migrations.sh <new_patch_version>"
            ```
        5.  **Deploy Application Code:** Update the code on all servers. This could be `git pull`, `rsync`, `scp`, or a deployment script.
            ```bash
            # Example using git on a single server:
            ssh user@your-server-ip "cd /srv/game && git fetch && git checkout <release_branch_or_tag> && ./install_dependencies.sh"
            # Or for multiple servers:
            # ansible-playbook deploy_code.yml -e version=<release_branch_or_tag>
            ```
        6.  **Clear Caches:** Clear any server-side or CDN caches.
            ```bash
            # Example:
            ssh user@your-server-ip "./clear_caches.sh"
            # aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DIST_ID --paths "/*" (for AWS CDN)
            ```
        7.  **Start Services:** Bring the game servers/application services back online.
            ```bash
            ssh user@your-server-ip "cd /srv/game && ./start-server.sh"
            # Or for multiple servers:
            # ansible-playbook start_game_servers.yml
            ```
        8.  **Verify:** Perform smoke tests and check critical functionality.
        9.  **End Maintenance:** Announce that maintenance is complete.

3.  **Post-Deployment Steps (Common to all strategies, though timing might vary):**

    *   **(If not part of a Blue/Green automated step) Execute Database Migrations:**
        *   Run any necessary database migration scripts. This should ideally be done during a period of low traffic or within the scheduled maintenance window if not handled by an automated Blue/Green swap.
        ```bash
        # Example: (if not done during an in-place update)
        ssh user@your-db-migration-host "cd /srv/migrations && ./run-migrations.sh --version=<new_patch_version>"
        ```
    *   **Clear Caches (if not done during a specific strategy's steps):**
        *   Clear any relevant server-side or CDN caches.
        ```bash
        # Example:
        # redis-cli FLUSHALL (if using Redis for caching and a full flush is appropriate)
        # (CDN invalidation commands vary by provider)
        ```
    *   **Restart Services (if not done as part of a rolling update or Blue/Green):**
        *   Perform a rolling restart of application services if necessary to ensure they pick up the new code and configuration.
        ```bash
        # Example for a rolling restart if using a service manager like systemd:
        # ansible all -m systemd -a "name=your-game-service state=restarted" --become
        ```

## Post-Patch Monitoring

After the patch is deployed to production:

1.  **Monitor Key Metrics:**
    *   Closely watch server performance metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O).
    *   Monitor error rates in logging systems.
    *   Check game-specific analytics for any unusual trends (e.g., drop in active players, high disconnect rates, unusual game outcomes).
2.  **Verify Critical Systems:**
    *   Confirm that core game functionalities are working as expected (e.g., login, matchmaking, in-game actions, purchases).
3.  **Community Feedback:**
    *   Monitor community channels for player reports of new issues.
4.  **Be Prepared to Rollback:**
    *   If critical issues are detected that cannot be quickly resolved, execute the rollback plan.

## Rollback Procedure

1.  **Decision:** The decision to roll back should be made quickly if major problems arise.
2.  **Communication:** Inform players if a rollback is necessary and when they can expect the game to be available again.
3.  **Revert Code:**
    *   If using Blue/Green, switch traffic back to the "blue" environment.
    *   Otherwise, redeploy the previous stable version of the code.
4.  **Restore Database (if necessary):**
    *   If the patch involved breaking database changes that were not backward-compatible, restore the database from the pre-patch backup. This is a critical step and can be time-consuming.
5.  **Post-Mortem:** After a rollback, conduct a thorough investigation to understand what went wrong and how to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Best Practices

*   **Automation:** Automate as much of the build, test, and deployment process as possible using CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage your server infrastructure using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation for consistency and reproducibility.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat servers as immutable. Instead of patching existing servers, deploy new servers with the updated code and then decommission the old ones.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for managing server configurations.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Ensure comprehensive logging is in place to help diagnose issues.
*   **Regular Drills:** Practice the patching and rollback procedures regularly in a non-production environment.
*   **Small, Frequent Patches:** Prefer smaller, more frequent patches over large, infrequent ones. This reduces the risk and complexity of each deployment.
*   **Zero-Downtime Focus:** Design your architecture and processes with the goal of achieving zero or minimal downtime during patching.

By following these procedures and best practices, you can ensure that server updates enhance the game and maintain a stable experience for your players.
